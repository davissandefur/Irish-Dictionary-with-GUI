Irish-Dictionary-with-GUI
=========================

This includes a modified version of Irish Dictionary, as well as a GUI to use everything with. It opens up a bare-bones
GUI (nothing pretty here) and allows users to input a word, then click whether it's an Irish word or an English word.
It then gets the HTML for the entry and returns the entry, suggestions, and a list of recently used words (max 5) to
the user. 

The option of language is also included, and the user can switch between Irish and English versions. Sound support is being worked on, if breis.focloir.ie contains the word.
