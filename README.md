Irish-Dictionary-with-GUI
=========================

This includes a modified version of Irish Dictionary, as well as a GUI to use everything with. It opens up a bare-bones
GUI (nothing pretty here) and allows users to input a word, then click whether it's an Irish word or an English word.
It then gets the HTML for the entry and returns the entry, suggestions, and a list of recently used words (max 5) to
the user. 

Uses GUI out of swampy. It can be dowloaded for free at: http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/swampy/. Eventually,
it will be moved away from Swampy and into a tkinter outline (which Swampy uses), however, the author's book was being
used when the program was created.
